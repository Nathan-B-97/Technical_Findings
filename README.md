# Technical_Findings
These are my Findings Report draft for the assessments I have done on virtual vulnerable machines. So far, these are only from vulnhub. Credits and big thanks for all the machine's creators as without them this would not be possible. Not only these authors made an excellent job setting these environments up, as they're giving access to it 100% free.
